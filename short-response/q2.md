# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

The steps to incorporating context into your application are to make a context object, render the Context Provider, and get and use the values in the context.

In the first step, create the context in a separate file where a variable uses `createContext` with the argument of a empty object. It is then exported.

In the second step, in the App Component, import the context variable. Then, create a variable that contains an object that stores the the different context values.

In the third step, wrap the components that will be using the context through referencing the variable in the context file in conjunction with Provider (`{variableName}.Provider`). The component will also contain a props of `value` that is equal to hte variable created in the second step. The `value` prop will determine the data available for the children components.

Now in any of the children components that is wrapped by the Provider will be able to use the states in the context through importing `useContext` and the context variable. Then, create a variable that is set to the `useContext` with the argument of the context variable.
